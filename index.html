            <h3>About Race Against Hunger </h3>
            <p>Race against hunger is an event promoting world hunger in Philadelphia. Many families are in need of food supply and food stamps. This event will help donate money to companies that serve food pantries, food stamps and families in need.  All the profits of this event will go to all organization in Philadelphia that support world hunger. This is to help people have a source of food and give them food stamps for their families. 
                Official start of the Race Against Hunger. Runners will start before the walkers. Runners will be timed, so it's important to be on the line ready to go for the 6:55am start.
